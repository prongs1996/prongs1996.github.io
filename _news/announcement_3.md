I have proposed two projects for the undergraduate summer research program at SoC @ NUS. Note that this is only available for undergrads at NUS.

---

If you are at NUS over the summer and are interested in working with me one DNA storage, please join one of my two proposed projects.
[Proposal 1](/assets/pdf/Puru_ClusteringDNAStrandsForDNA-basedDataStorage.pdf) tackles the clustering problem in DNA storage, [Proposal 2](/assets/pdf/Puru_ReconstructingDNAStrandsForDNA-basedDataStorage.pdf) tackles the trace reconstruction problem.

Update 21/3/2024: The applications for these projects are now closed.
