I am a Computer Science PhD candidate at the National University of Singapore, where my research is supervised by Assistant Professor [Djordje Jevdjic](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~jevdjic) and Associate Professor [Weng-Fai Wong](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~wongwf/).

My current research focuses on figuring out how to store data in DNA. There's way too much data being generated every day, and we are quickly running out of space to store it. DNA has been proposed as both a very desirable and very cool solution! My work is very interdisciplinary and brings together Computer Systems, Algorithms, Machine Learning and Computational Biology.

Outside of my research, I am very passionate about [movies](https://letterboxd.com/prongs17/), [games](https://steamcommunity.com/id/prongs17/) and sports (EPL, NFL, NBA).
